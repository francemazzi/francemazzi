# 👋 Hi, I'm FraSma — Software Developer in AgriTech & Manufacturing    

✨ **Innovator at the Intersection of Technology and AgriTech** ✨

🌾 **What I do**  
- Design and build **end-to-end platforms** for agriculture and the **food supply chain**  
- Help **farmers, agronomists and food companies** digitalize workflows, compliance and decision-making  
- Collaborate with **innovative startups** and **manufacturing companies** to optimize processes with data, automation and AI  

🧠 **Currently exploring**  
- **TensorFlow** for ML-powered decision support in agriculture  
- **Scapy** and low-level networking for smarter, more robust integrations  

🌱 **Fun fact**  
- I designed and built a modular **vertical farm** from scratch, merging sustainability, hardware and software
